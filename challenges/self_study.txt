1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

    a. forEach: is a method that loops over a given array and returns the items conainted in the array. forEach does not create a new array.

    b. map: Unlike the forEach method, the map method transforms each item in an array and returns those changes in a new array.


2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

    a. Function: a function is an independent object, that passes in values explicity and returns a task of code written in it..

    b. Method: is similar to a function, but it is used as property of a class or constructor function to pass in values.


3. What is closure?

    Closure refers to the scope of a function. A function has access to its local or block scope. If it doesn't find anything in its local scope, then it will look up to its global scope to return a statment or variable.



4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

    a. Window Bind: refers to the global scope

    b. Implicit Bind: refers to anytime we use dot notation to invoke a function

    c. Explicit Bind: refers to anytime we use the call/apply/bind methods. Explict binding tells a function what object it should use.

    d. New Bind: refers to the instantiation and creation of a new object. This new instance becomes a object of the parent function/class.



5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

    Super() allows the properties of the parent class or classes to be passed into the current subclass.
